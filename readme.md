# Novel ICA
Blind Source Separation (BSS) is often used to solve the cocktail party problem, which is an attempt to separate a group of source signals from a set of mixed signals.
In general, BSS is used for image, audio, medical EEG, and communication MIMO analysis.
However, in the era of 5G, increasing demand for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) toward these applications becomes urgent, especially acoustic signal processing in IoT networks. Therefore, this project primarily explores BSS algorithms for URLLC and intends to virtualize it to integrate it into 5G networks.

## Overview
This project contains:
1. FastICA, baseline algorithm from A. Hyvarinen.
2. CdICA, Component-dependent Independent Component Analysis.
3. AeICA, Adaptive-extraction Independent Component Analysis.
4. UfICA, Unified Independent Component Analysis.
5. MeICA, Multi-level Extraction Independent Component Analysis.

The implementation is based on FastICA in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). 

## Install 
This project uses Python. Following packages are required:
- numpy
- scipy
- museval
- progressbar2
- ffmpeg

These could be installed by `conda install numpy scipy museval progressbar2 ffmpeg`, if the environment is managed by Anaconda.

A test data set from [Google Audio Set](https://research.google.com/audioset/) is provided for testing.

## Usage : pyfassbass_testbed
The core analysis algorithm is given in `pyfastbss_core.py`.

Signal reading and writing, as well as data pre-processing and evaluation, are done by `pyfastbss_testbed.py`.

Testing setup can be done in `pyfastbss_example.py`. Test results, including Separation Accuracy and Separation Time, are stored as ***.csv*** in the folder `test_results/google_dataset`. An example of using the algorithm FastICA is given below:
```python
S, A, X = pyfbss_tb.generate_matrix_S_A_X(
                folder_address, duration, source_number, mixing_type="normal", max_min=(1, 0.01), mu_sigma=(0, 1))
eval_type = 'sdr'

pyfbss_tb.timer_start()
hat_S = pyfbss.fastica(X, max_iter=100, tol=1e-04)
time = pyfbss_tb.timer_value()
Eval_dB = pyfbss_tb.bss_evaluation(S, hat_S, eval_type)
print('FastICA: ', Eval_dB, '; ', time)
```

Test data set is in the fold `google_dataset`. More data set can be downloaded by using the tool ***Youtube Downloader*** in `youtube_downloader`
## Usage : Microservice
This part's core and alogrithm also base on `pyfastbss_core.py`.

Here is Information to run the Simulator of Microservice
```
  --iter_time {0,1} {0,1}
                        get meantime of iteration and plot eachtime and iter num, default [0,0]
  --run_FastICA         run FastICA
  --run_MeICA           run MeICA
  --run_Simulator       run time Simulator, it will simulate the time base on    our microsevice, you can setting the latency and performance for simulator, see help
  --source_num SOURCE_NUM
                        setting source number, default: 5
  --service_latency SERVICE_LATENCY
                        setting the latency of service for origin MeICA, 
                        default: 50 [ms]
  --service_performance SERVICE_PERFORMANCE
                        setting the performance of service compare to mircoservice, 
                        default: 10 [times]
  --micro_latency MICRO_LATENCY
                        setting the latency of micro service, default: 0.5 [ms]
```
